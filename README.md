To Do List
========

This is an epicodus assignment.

Make a To Do List web page.

First, make it so that the person visiting the page can add tasks.
After you get that working, make it so that the user can create multiple lists, each with their own tasks
Then, make it so that the user can mark a task as done, and it should move to the bottom of the page.
If you get this far, add due dates and priority (on a scale of 1-5) for tasks.
Finally, add the ability to sort tasks by name, due date, or priority.
